This involved comparing large sets of data to each other and manipulating the data in such a way that we could still see everything we needed.",

        that did everything Google Forms does and then some. I built the
        front-end for this project and queried all the data from the database
        our backend engineer built using a Graphql server. I build countless
        tables and grids for displaying data and just as many inputs for
        altering data (so many mutations!)"
